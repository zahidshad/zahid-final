Consult a specialist to develop a program that’s right for your and your back. <br>
            >Try yoga. Both back pain sufferers and doctors give it high ratings for building strength and flexibility. It also helps your relax and reduce stress. <br>
            >Wear comfortable, low-heeled shoes. <br>
            >If you sit for long periods, make sure your work surface is at a comfortable height and that your chair provides good lower back support. Walk around for a few minutes every half hour or so. <br>
            >Don’t lift and twist at the same time. Lift with your legs, not your back, and lift as little weight each time as possible. <br>
